# Kanji-Learning-Program
A small program that I use to help me memorize Kanji

Mainly used for learning. Only usable in a JDE due to Windows terminal not being able to utilize UTF-8 encoding. Should work if you put it in one that can, though.
Keep the files and the main program in the same folder for it to work.

Currently the files past Collection 2 have an ordering issue, so I will get on that.

Instructions:
Exam: Quizes you. You get 10 seconds to answer 6 out of 12 questions.
Collection: Able to see which collections there are
